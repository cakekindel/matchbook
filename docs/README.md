### What is Pattern Matching?
Pattern matching is a  modern language feature
that acts like a `switch` / `case` statement
on steroids ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ª.

You might consider using pattern matching if you
need to switch on Types or states frequently,
and want to handle the different cases in a 
**concise** and **expressive** way.

This project takes heavy inspiration from
[Rust's pattern matching idiom][rust_match].

### Examples

#### Handle objects that differ by a discriminator
_A Discriminator is a fancy word for a property on an object
that tells you what kind of object it is._
